\section{Spaces}

The space functions as the top level governance structure of the fabric that orchestrates how providers cooperate to serve tenant data. 
Governance is TBD.

\subsection{Space rules}

  \item[Provider Bond] An amount, $\bond{prov}$, of currency each provider must lock up in order to participate within the space. Funds can be slashed from here if a provider misbehaves.
  \item[Tenant Bond] An amount, $\bond{ten}$, of currency each tenant must lock up in order to participate within the space. Funds can be slashed from here if a tenant misbehaves.
  \item[SLAs] Specifications for availability requirements provider nodes must have.
  \item[Partition number] The partitioning constant for part storage
