\section{Spaces}

The space functions as the top level governance structure of the fabric that orchestrates how providers cooperate to serve tenant data. 
It is responsible for
\begin{itemize}
  \item Creating providers
  \item Creating tenants
  \item Defining rules of the space which tenants/providers agree to abide by
  \item Reserving slashable bonds for both providers and tenants
  \item Governance, including
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Admitting new tenants/providers
      \item Removing misbehaving tenants/providers
      \item Slashing tenants/providers
      \item Changing rules
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
